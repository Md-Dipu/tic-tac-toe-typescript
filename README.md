# Tic tac toe: Web game

This project is an offline 2-player mood board game made by typescript. Tic-Tac-Toe, Knots and Crosses or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking spaces on a three-by-three grid with X's or O's. The player who succeeds in placing three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. That game is developed as a web game on the web page using HTML, CSS, and Typescript.
